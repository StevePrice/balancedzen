This project is a personal exploration in building a full stack reactive meteor application. It is not
inteded as a guide for anyone but myself.
Oftentimes there are gaps between the tutorials, samples, and example programs provided by MDG and the
applications we envision in our minds. This is my attempt at bridging those gaps and learning to write great code.
